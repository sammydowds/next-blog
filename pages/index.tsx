						Hi, I am Sammy!
						Github, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Resume
						I am a full-stack engineer who loves to learn and build new things. I started my career as a Mechanical Engineer after graduation from Oklahoma State University in 2016. My curiosity lead me to web dev (self-taught), and I have not looked back since.

						Right now I am focused on frontend tech, but I also have an appreciation for the backend side of things (CRON, Django, Fastly, FastApi, etc). On the frontend, I have experience with Express, React, Redux, Node, Deno, and Next JS - typically all written in TypeScript.

						Outside of appreciating the beautiful mess of Frontend, I enjoy gaming, running, and watching sports (big NBA guy). My focus is becoming a better engineer, staying healthy, and maintaining a healthy balance in life.
