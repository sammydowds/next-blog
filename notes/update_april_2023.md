# My first 8k, Enjoying Hawaii, AI Hype, and books

I have had a fun couple of months. I wanted to share some accomplishments, pictures of vacation, and what I read + am learning. Buckle in!

## 8k - Shamrock Shuffle

I completed the Shamrock Shuffle in March. 5 miles, and my goal was to have about a ~9min pace. I finished with roughly a 9:30 pace. I had COVID 2 weeks before the race, so I will take it. 

It was challenging and fun.

## O'ahu, Hawaii

We went on a vacation to Hawaii in April. I took the opportunity to unplug from society, read some books, and enjoy time with my queen. 

Some things you must do if you go to O'ahu:
- [Lanikai Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanikai_Beach) 
- [Go to the market near Lanikai](https://kalapawaimarket.com/kailua-beach)
- [Do not trust reviews that say hiking to the pillbox on Lanikai is easy](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/lanikai-pillboxes?u=i)

## Books

On vacation, I read and started reading a few books. 

I read [The Chaos Machine by Max Fisher](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Machine-Inside-Social-Rewired/dp/031670332X). It highlights the history and potential issues of algorithms driving platforms. I found it to be a solid read. 

After reading that, I started on [The Delusions of Crowds by William J. Bernstein](https://www.amazon.com/Delusions-Crowds-Why-People-Groups/dp/0802157092). I would say its good so far, but at times can be a bit too in depth on the history of things.

## Learning

Before vacation, I figured I would start diving into the world of machine learning during the 18 hours of plane time. AI is all the rage right now with the introduction of ChatGPT and the arms race to now utilize AI in any way possible. 

A couple of resources I have hunted down for learning about machine learning & deep learning: 
- [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- [Read papers published by OpenAI](https://openai.com/research)
- I learned of [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) research for papers
- Online Free Course (audit each course individually - free): https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction

My goal is to gain some knowledge on the fundamentals. Also I miss math.  

## Conclusion

I am happy with my last few months: running, relaxing, reading, and learning. I hope this post is helpful in some way!
