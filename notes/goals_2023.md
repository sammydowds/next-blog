# Goals For 2023

- Run an 8k. [Shamrock Shuffle](https://www.shamrockshuffle.com/)
- Run a 10k. [Hoover Damn](https://www.bbscrun.com/hoover-dam-marathon/)
- Weight lift 3x per week. [Fitbod](https://fitbod.me/)
- Eat out only 2-3x per month. [Eat This Much for planning](https://www.eatthismuch.com/)
- Continue to learn and post about technical learnings (via this blog!)

## Running

I never thought I would be a runner. But something happened in July of 2022. I suddenly [started running 3x per week](/running.png), and took the 5k training plan via my Garmin watch app. I _highly_ recommend the [Forerunner 45](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/641121) if you are looking for a solid smart watch to get you started.

## Eating Healthy

This has been a constant struggle for me for years. Its time to nail this down.

After thinking about building something for myself to build meal plans weekly, I came to the realization that whatever I build probably wouldn't be nearly as complete as [Eat This Much](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) which seems to do exactly what I want. So, I paid the $47 for an annual subscription.

## Blogging

I really intend blogging to bring a few benefits to my life:

1. Capture my learnings
2. Share my learnings
3. Build my digital platform

I dont see myself ever being a successful writer, but the intent is to help others and build a brand.

## Conclusion

These goals are to build on momentum that I naturally built towards the end of 2022. I look forward to seeing what happens in 2023!
