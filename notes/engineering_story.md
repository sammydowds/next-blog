# From Mechanical Engineer to Software Developer

I started my career as a mechanical engineer (B.S. Oklahoma State University), and after 4 years in the industry I switched careers to become a full stack software engineer.

I will give some details on how this journey lead me to spending all free hours coding, trying to convince my coworkers they should use my terrible app, dropping out of a Comp Sci Masters program, and quitting my job.

## Timeline of my journey

### 2015

During my Mechanical Engineering degree, I took [Computer Methods](http://catalog.okstate.edu/courses/mae/) which was essentially an intro class to Python 3. We went from learning how to code to modeling systems. I loved my courses throughout the degree, but I looked forward to going to this course more than most.

### 2017

I graduated from [Oklahoma State](https://ceat.okstate.edu/mae/) in December of 2016 and moved to Greenville, SC where I worked for [Michelin](https://www.michelin.com/en/) in their central engineering. This was a great job out of college. During this time I was continuing to code Python scripts after work.

### Late 2018 & 2019

I moved to Omaha, NE and worked at [Acieta](https://www.acieta.com/) as a project manager. I found myself growing tired of not coding for my full time job.

I started learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and began working on a project management app built as an alternative to working in excel. I actually presented this app to Acieta and even onboarded some of the Project Managers to test out.

### 2020

I quit my job in May of 2020. During that time I was moving to Chicago and I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to switch careers after polishing up my skillset.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) were required in a lot of job postings - so I took a course via Coursera on [React and Redux from the University of Hong Kong](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react).

In October of 2020 I started at [Zumper](https://www.zumper.com/) as a Jr Full Stack Eng.

## My favorite memories from the journey

### Learning on the bus

At Michelin, I worked on a team that was responsible for managing the entire after-cure manufacturing process for a new plant in Mexico. During this time I was traveling to Mexico a lot while working through coursework in [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0).

The engineers would take a 30 minute bus ride to the plant everyday, and I used that time to watch CS50 modules. For me, this was a big pivot point in my dedication and built a lot of momentum for years to come.

### Deploying my first Django app

I sat in [Legend Comic's Coffee Shop](https://www.facebook.com/LegendComics/) in Omaha and spent 4 hours trying to deploy my first [Django app](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

I had no clue what I was doing. The feeling of running a command on my computer and then accessing the site on my phone was awesome.

### Dropping out of a Masters program

I actually started a Computer Science Master's [program at UNO](https://www.unomaha.edu/) in 2018.

I walked into my first class, got my computer out, and prepared myself for learning something new. The professor then described how the course structure would work:

1. We would go home, take the online module
2. Come back with questions
3. Repeat

I was already doing half of this for free with online courses via edX and Coursera. The degree was going to cost North of $15,000. I dropped out.

## How to switch careers into Web Dev (on a budget)

If you are trying to switch to a career as a web dev with as little money spent as possible, I recommend this path:

- Start a [Github account](https://github.com/)
- Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to develop with
- Take [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)
- Take [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
- Take 2 courses on Web Dev (one Backend and one Frontend focused)
- Solve some problems for yourself with code via a popular language (a lot of the code I wrote in the beginning was to solve problems for myself)
- Do some portfolio projects with _in-demand_ skills (for me I did Django and a React/Redux app)

Ultimately, you need to code. Nothing can replace the hours of writing code yourself and struggling through learning new things while you are coding.

## How did I stay motivated?

I had a mix of shows/hobbies/youtube channels that I watched. Later the online free courses helped me scratch an itch to building web apps.

- Free online courses at [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- Crawling through questions I had about how the internet works with Google
- Watching [George Hotz hack/bootstrap Comma AI](https://www.youtube.com/c/georgehotzarchive?app=desktop)
- [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ)
- [Mr Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/)
- Video Games (caffiene driven gaming and coding sessions)

## Conclusion

My journey from mechanical engineer to software developer was a grind for over 3+ years. If you have an interest in switching into software development, I recommend solving problems you have with languages, frameworks, and tools that are most popular at companies you want to work at.
