# Laid Off 

Well, that was fun. I switched careers from a career in industrial robotics in 2020. On reflecting over the last 6 years I am extremely proud of them. I have gone from manufacturing floors across North America, to a cubicle in Iowa, to a WeWork in the center of downtown Chicago, and now to a humble home-office in Edmond, OK. 

My skillset grew from Solidworks, mechanical design, integration of large industrial equipment, coordination of large teams, 80% travel, flow analysis through factories to writing API endpoints, CRON jobs, Queue consumers, Database tables, entire webservers serving web pages, and how to optimize and build frontend applications. 

## What is Next? 

I love building things. I want to continue building my skill of writing entire systems that fulfill the needs of users.
