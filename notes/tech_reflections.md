# Reflections on Breaking Into Tech

When I entered the tech industry after learning how to code, I had no idea what to expect. I wanted to capture my thoughts and my opinions after a few years in the industry.

**You will feel like you do not belong** at times. The tech industry (especially when working on the Frontend), moves quickly and has a lot of rapidly changing best practices. For example, I learned class-based components when I first learned React. One month later, React came out with a new way of doing things and recommended not using class-based components.

**There is a lot of ego** in the tech industry. I think this comes from the hype around silicon valley, specialized knowledge, and high salaries. Dont let others put you down or make you feel bad for not knowing something.

**Never assume you know more than others**. I guess this applies to all areas of life. For the very reason above, never have a closed mind on what you can learn and what others can do. Do not compete with others. Take it day by day, and make sure to take some time to take care of yourself.

**Maintain boundaries** between work and home. I think this especially true with your workload. I personally think its important to continue building and learning in your personal time. However, if work is too stressful - you should take time to focus on relaxing.

**It is a constant cycle of learning** which is both amazing and exhausting. I think this ties into the point above. If you feel exhausted, but are learning on the job, take time to relax. You are doing great. This feeling of constant learning can also have negative impacts and have a flywheel effect on how you view yourself.

**When complaining about the existing code** make sure to understand the context of why it is there in the first place before calling for its deletion. Second order thinking can save a lot of time, and help you feel better about why its there. [Dont remove fences](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/).

If you are new to the industry, it can be a tough first few years. Especially entering into a codebase that has been around for 5+ years. Take it day by day. Continue to learn. Never compare yourself to others.
